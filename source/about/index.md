# CAREER PROFILE
---
* Master Student in Computer Science with Cognitive Systems as specialty
* Solid theoretical knowledge of machine learning.
* Great Passion for software development and artificial intelligence.

# EDUCATION
---
* **Technical University of Berlin**, Berlin, Germany 2016-Present
   *Master Student* in Computer Science with Cognitive Systems as specialty
* **Xidian University**, Xi'An, China    2012-2016
   *B.S.* in Software Engineering

# EXPERIENCE
---
* **DAI (Distributed Artificial Intelligence) Labor**, Berlin, Germany  starts from 2018.04
   *Student Research Assistant* at IRML (Information Retrieval & Machine Learning) Department
* **Fraunhofer FOKUS**, Berlin, Germany  2017.02-2018.02
   *Student Research Assistant* at NGN (Next Generation Network) Department
   * Fraunhofer-Institut Für Offene KommUnikations Systeme (FOKUS) is a German research institute, exporing and developing the networked world and making it secure, reliable and trustworthy.
   * I worked at Next Generation Network (NGN) department and participated in the development of 5G core network. The project is mainly written in **C** together with **C++**, **XML** as well as **JSON** and deployed on Linux. Google’s [**test framework**](https://github.com/google/googletest) is introduced and used.
   * Responsible for the benchmarking tool module, whose main functionalities are to benchmark the 5G core network and simplify deployment and testing procedure
   * Integrated all related components into benchmarking tool module. As a result, instead of deploying each component on its exclusive machine for demonstration or testing, all 5G network procedures could be easily simulated and tracked inside benchmarking tool and one machine is enough.
   * Implemented key metrics tracking and session management.
   * Designed and implemented automatic scenario generation algorithm such that batch of complex test cases could be generated in an easier way.
