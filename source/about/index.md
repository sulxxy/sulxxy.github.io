# Introduction
Hi, everyone! 
My name is Zhiwei Liu and welcome to my GitHub pages:-) I'm a student from China. So, as you can see from this website, some of passages are written in Chinese and others are in English. I majored Software Engineering during my undergraduate stage in Xidian University in China. And now I am mojoring Embedded Systems in Technique Universy Berlin in Germany. In the automn of 2017, I will major Embedded System Platform in KTH in Sweden. While I major Embedded Systems, I prefer to become a software engineer in the future because I'm more interested on programming on a little high level, such as driven, operating systems, or system softwares. Besides this, I have ever done some research on natural language understanding and deep learning, which are great fields to learn. Also, I'm very interested in IoT(internet of things). It's really funny to connect every smart thing and make them under your control.
To summerize, 
1. I'm(will be) a software engineering who has ever majored Embedded Systems. 
2. I'm interested in IoT and AI.

# About this site
OK, now please allow me to introduce this site shortly.
Here is the place where I record what I have learned from books or courses(category *Study Notes*) as well as some technique issues(category *Technique*). Also, I wrote some comments on the books I've read and the moives I've watched because I really like books and movies which locate in the category of *Essays*. 
Under the cagetory of *Study Notes*, there are 3 kinds of pre-fixes:
1. Coursera Course: \*\*\*
2. Univerisity Course: \*\*\*
3. Book: \*\*\*

All of notes in this category are actually a summary of the name of this course or book because this site only has one level category. Every course or book listed in this category would have an independent github respository in which I would write and submit some wikis and these wikis would include all of my notes and give much more details about this course or book.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me:
