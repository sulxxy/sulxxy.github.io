When installing some packages on Raspbian, there's always a Perl warning message like this:
{% codeblock %}
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
		LANGUAGE = (unset),
		LC_ALL = (unset),
		LC_CTYPE = "UTF-8",
		LANG = "en_GB.UTF-8"
	are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
{% endcodeblock %}
<!-- more -->

To deal with this problem, we can modify the file <b>/etc/default/locale/</b> to look like next:
{% codeblock %}
# File generated by update-locale
LANG=en.US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en.US:en
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
{% endcodeblock %}

By doing this, the warning will disappear after rebooting.
