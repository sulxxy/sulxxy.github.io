# Introduction
Wireless sensor networks are large-scale networks of nodes comprised of sensing elements (temperature, acceleration, humidity, pressure, light, etc.), a processing element and a wireless transceiver. The nodes collaborate in application tasks ranging from environmental monitoring, health monitoring, surveillance, building automation, etc.

Sensor networks differ from "traditional" wireless networks in several aspects, most importantly in their resource constrained nature. The sensor nodes are typically severely restricted in terms of memory, processing capacity and energy budget leading to the need for careful design of the node system software and protocol stack. These novel system solutions, driven by the specific nature of the sensor networks as a platform, are the focus of our interest in this course.

# Sensor Networks Lab
The sensor networks lab provides opportunity for gaining hands-on experience in working with state-of-the-art sensornet hardware and software. Motes will be made available not only for in-class assignments but also for developing experiments at home.

The lab consists of a "bootcamp" event and 6 additional Labs. In the "bootcamp" the TinyOS toolchain is installed and tested with simple demo applications. The following lab sessions are devoted to particular aspects of sensor network hardware and software stack like sensing, actuation, IPv6-based networking, etc. The lab ends with group mini-project work.
