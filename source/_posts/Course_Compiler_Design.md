# Overview
This course introduces the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers. You will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans translates into a program written in low-level assembly.

# Theory
1. Lexical analysis
1. Parsing
1. Semantic analysis
1. Intermediate representations
1. Code generation & runtime
1. Dataflow analysis
1. Program optimization

# Practical
1. Implementing a lexer (LEX)
1. Implementing a parser (BISON)
1. Analysis and optimization of C programs with the LLVM compiler
